Topological sorting is an algorithm that takes a graph consisting of
nodes and other nodes that depend on them, forming a partial order,
and returns a list representing a total ordering of the graph. If the
graph is cyclic, the topological sort will fail. With the
procedure <code>topological-sort</code>, failure results in
returning <code>#false</code> and additional information is provided
via multiple values.
